# kawaii-todo

A small, cute, client-side todo app with a kawaii aesthetic. Built with plain HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS (via CDN). Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage so your todos persist on the same device.

## Features

- Add tasks with optional due date and time
- Mark tasks complete / uncomplete
- Delete tasks
- Overdue detection for tasks with due dates/times
- Daily and weekly progress summaries
- Cute, animated UI using CSS and Tailwind

## Files

- `index.html` — The entire app (UI + logic). Open this file in a browser to run the app.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SowmiyaHualian/kawaii-todo.git
cd kawaii-todo
```

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No build steps required.

3. Add tasks using the input, optionally set a due date/time, and manage tasks from the UI. Data is saved to your browser's localStorage.

## Serve as a site (optional)

You can enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (branch: `main`, folder: `/`) to serve `index.html` as a simple site.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or PRs. Suggestions:

- Move UI to separate CSS/JS files
- Add persistent backend storage (Firebase / Supabase / REST API)
- Add authentication to sync across devices
